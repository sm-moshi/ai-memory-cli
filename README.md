## Vision & Philosophy

AI Memory CLI is designed for developers who want a robust, modular, and persistent project memory—**without any webview or GUI overhead**. It is CLI-first, Cursor-native, and rules-driven, providing seamless integration with:

- **Cursor Command Palette**: All memory bank commands are available for quick access.
- **Output Window**: All actions and errors are logged for transparency and debugging.
- **Agent/Command (Chat) Workflows**: `/memory`, `/note`, and `/plan` commands are available in chat and automation.

**No webview, no Electron, no distractions—just a stable, extensible memory bank for your project.**

## Why?

Cursor 0.50+ introduces an MCP CLI entry‑point, yet it still lacks a lightweight,
headless tool for **persistent project memory**.
_AI Memory CLI_ fills that gap:

* **Stores** rich markdown memory in a modular folder.
* **Serves** it through an MCP stdio server (`ai-memory-cli`).
* **Responds** to chat commands like `/memory status`, `/note`, `/plan`.
* **Logs** neatly to VS Code / Cursor *Output* channel.
* **No WebView, no Electron overhead**.

## Quick start

```bash
# one‑shot
npx ai-memory-cli --init

# during development
pnpm install
pnpm build:cli
./dist/ai-memory-cli --stdio
```

*Requires Node ≥ 20.19 and TypeScript ≥ 5.4 (bundled).*

## CLI Usage

The AI Memory CLI provides commands to interact with your memory bank:

```sh
ai-memory-cli status
ai-memory-cli read <relativePath>
ai-memory-cli chunk <relativePath> <chunkIndex> [chunkSize]
ai-memory-cli list <subfolder>
```

- `status`: Checks if the memory bank is initialised and healthy.
- `read <relativePath>`: Reads and prints the contents of a memory bank file.
- `chunk <relativePath> <chunkIndex> [chunkSize]`: Reads a chunk of a file (default chunk size: 15,000 bytes).
- `list <subfolder>`: Lists all files in the given memory bank subfolder (e.g., `core`, `systemPatterns`).

Example:
```sh
ai-memory-cli list core
```
