## Vision & Philosophy

AI Memory CLI is designed for developers who want a robust, modular, and persistent project memoryâ€”**without any webview or GUI overhead**. It is CLI-first, Cursor-native, and rules-driven, providing seamless integration with:

- **Cursor Command Palette**: All memory bank commands are available for quick access.
- **Output Window**: All actions and errors are logged for transparency and debugging.
- **Agent/Command (Chat) Workflows**: `/memory`, `/note`, and `/plan` commands are available in chat and automation.

**No webview, no Electron, no distractionsâ€”just a stable, extensible memory bank for your project.**

---

## Why AI Memory CLI?

Cursor 0.50+ introduces an MCP CLI entryâ€‘point, yet it still lacks a lightweight, headless tool for **persistent project memory**.
_AI Memory CLI_ fills that gap:

- **Stores** rich markdown memory in a modular folder.
- **Serves** it through an MCP stdio server (`ai-memory-cli`).
- **Responds** to chat commands like `/memory status`, `/note`, `/plan`.
- **Logs** neatly to VS Code / Cursor *Output* channel.
- **No WebView, no Electron overhead**.

## Quick Start

```bash
# oneâ€‘shot
npx ai-memory-cli --init

# during development
pnpm install
pnpm build:cli
./dist/ai-memory-cli --stdio
```

> [!NOTE]
> Requires Node â‰¥ 20.19 and TypeScript â‰¥ 5.4 (bundled).

---

## Configuration & Options

- **CLI flags:**
  - `--stdio` (default): Run as stdio MCP agent (recommended for Cursor 0.50+)
  - `--http [--port <number>]`: Run as HTTP/SSE MCP agent (legacy/fallback)
  - `--init`: Initialise a new memory bank
  - `--log-level <level>`: Set log verbosity (trace, debug, info, warning, error, off)
- **Environment variables:**
  - `AI_MEMORY_CLI_CONFIG`: Path to custom config file (optional)
- **VS Code Extension Settings:**
  - Log level, Output window integration, Command Palette commands

---

## CLI Usage

```sh
ai-memory-cli status
ai-memory-cli read <relativePath>
ai-memory-cli chunk <relativePath> <chunkIndex> [chunkSize]
ai-memory-cli list <subfolder>
ai-memory-cli write <relativePath> <content>
```

- `status`: Checks if the memory bank is initialised and healthy.
- `read <relativePath>`: Reads and prints the contents of a memory bank file.
- `chunk <relativePath> <chunkIndex> [chunkSize]`: Reads a chunk of a file (default chunk size: 15,000 bytes).
- `list <subfolder>`: Lists all files in the given memory bank subfolder (e.g., `core`, `systemPatterns`).
- `write <relativePath> <content>`: Writes the given content to the specified memory bank file.

> [!NOTE]
> Validation is enforced on both read and write for `core/projectbrief.md`, `core/productContext.md`, and `core/activeContext.md`. If a required section is missing, the operation will fail with a clear error. To fix, ensure your file includes all required headings as shown in the templates.

Example:
```sh
ai-memory-cli list core
ai-memory-cli write core/test.md "Hello, Memory Bank!"
```

## User Experience: CLI and GUI

While AI Memory CLI is designed as a CLI-first toolkit for robust agent and automation workflows, **end users interact with memory features primarily through Cursor's GUI**. This includes:

- **/memory command**: Available in Cursor chat, command palette, and agent workflows. Users can check memory status, read files, and more without leaving the GUI.
- **/plan command (planned)**: Will be available both via CLI and as a chat/command palette feature in Cursor, enabling planning and roadmap workflows directly from the GUI.

> [!TIP]
> The CLI is ideal for development, automation, and advanced scripting, but most users will use memory features through Cursor's graphical interface.
