# AI Memory Extension Roadmap

> This file is the internal, detailed roadmap and planning document. For the canonical, public-facing roadmap, see [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) in the project root. Keep these in sync.

## Vision

Empower Cursor and VS Code users with a robust, modular, and user-editable memory bank, enabling persistent, context-aware AI interactions and seamless context resets.

---

## Milestones

### v0.1.x (Complete)
- [x] Modular memory bank structure (`core/`, `systemPatterns/`, `techContext/`, `progress/`)
- [x] MCP server with robust error handling
- [ ] Webview UI for memory bank management (not present in CLI codebase)
- [x] Migration logic for flat â†’ modular memory bank
- [x] Public documentation in `docs/`, private memory in `memory-bank/`
- [x] Cursor 0.49+ and VS Code compatibility
- [x] Ignore files reviewed and fixed; packaging issues resolved; 0.1.5 is new stable baseline (May 2025)

### v0.2.x (Current)
- [x] Full modularisation of codebase (core, mcp, webview, types, utils, test)
- [x] MCP CLI/stdio entrypoint for Cursor-first operation
- [ ] Webview UI overhaul (React/Tailwind, status, repair, management) (not present in CLI codebase)
- [x] Self-healing memory bank and rules management (rules parsing not yet implemented)
- [x] MCP tools exposed and robust
- [ ] Refactor extension to remove Express and use Cursor/VS Code APIs for all communication (not present in CLI codebase)
- [ ] User-configurable log levels for Output Channel (not implemented)
- [ ] Webview error and event reporting to Output Channel (not present in CLI codebase)
- [ ] Version control integration for memory bank files
- [ ] Enhanced webview: file previews, diffs, and history
- [ ] Visualisation tools for memory relationships (webview)
- [ ] More granular permissions and user roles
- [ ] Add 'AI Memory: Create Memory Bank Rule' command to create/restore memory-bank.mdc from template or rules source (not implemented)
- [ ] Implement user prompt to overwrite if file exists (see cursor-rules-service.ts) (not implemented)
- [ ] Implement rules parsing and command handler logic (not implemented)
- [ ] Implement /plan command and planner logic (not implemented)

### v1.0.0 (Stable)
- [ ] Full test coverage and CI/CD for all features
- [ ] Open VSX and VS Code Marketplace release
- [ ] User feedback integration and UX polish
- [ ] Advanced troubleshooting and diagnostics UI
- [ ] Community templates and extension points

---

## Long-Term Ideas
- AI-driven memory bank suggestions and auto-updates
- Integration with other LLMs and agent frameworks
- Multi-project and workspace memory management
- Plugin system for custom memory bank modules
- Remote/Cloud memory bank support

---

## Action Plan (May 2025)

- [x] Refactor extension to modular, Cursor-first structure (core, mcp, webview, types, utils, test)
- [x] Add MCP CLI/stdio entrypoint for Cursor-first operation
- [ ] Webview UI overhaul and robust feedback (not present in CLI codebase)
- [x] Self-healing memory bank and rules management (rules parsing not yet implemented)
- [ ] Remove Express and use Cursor/VS Code APIs for all communication (not present in CLI codebase)
- [ ] User-configurable log levels and webview error/event reporting (not implemented)
- [ ] Version control integration, advanced UI, and chunked file access (future)
- [ ] Test activation, command registration, and MCP tool operation in Cursor (and optionally VS Code)
- [ ] Document findings and next steps in this ROADMAP.

---

**Notes (2025-05-17):**
- The codebase is now Cursor-first, with VS Code compatibility as a bonus.
- Modularisation, MCP CLI/stdio, and self-healing are complete.
- Rules parsing, command handler, /plan command, and output channel logger are not implemented.
- Docs, rules, and packaging are up-to-date.

For a detailed, step-by-step experimental plan to safely prototype advanced MCP features (chunked file access, metadata, planner tools), see [EXPERIMENTAL-MCP-PLAN.md](../experimental/EXPERIMENTAL-MCP-PLAN.md).

## Optional: Advanced MCP Roadmap (Experimental)

> The following roadmap is based on advanced internal planning for MCP features. These features are **optional** and should be implemented with caution, as previous attempts caused instability. Use for reference and future planning only.

### Phase 1: Core MCP Features
- Add chunked reading and size warnings to `get-memory-bank-file`
- Add rule-bound validation and append/replace mode to `update-memory-bank-file`
- Implement `get-memory-bank-metadata` tool for file list, size, modifiedAt, chunkCount

### Phase 2: Planner Tools
- Implement `/plan` command tool to extract plan from `progress/current.md` and `core/activeContext.md`
- Add `update-current-plan` tool for AI-driven plan updates (with validation and optional backup)

### Phase 3: Rule Enforcement & Limits
- Enforce chunked reading with default chunk size (e.g., 2000 chars)
- Show warnings for large files (>15KB, >30KB)
- Enable `.mdc` planner mode for auto `/plan` logic

### Phase 4: DevOps & Integration
- Use Git Flow for release branches and tagging
- Tag and publish after full MCP re-validation and test suite

### Optional Advanced Ideas
- Implement feedback hooks for MCP-driven rule service
- Support MCP UI injection of `memory-bank-rules.md` in dashboard
- Allow GitHub Action to regenerate `.mdc` from schema
